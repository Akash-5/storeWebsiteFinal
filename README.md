# storeWebsiteFinal
Code can be improved/cleaned up a bunch but im very proud of this and had a great time, all of my links work including my social media links. Only problem is if I go from my about me page to my details  page sometimes it will run a website not found but everything else is connected fine and runs with my problems, hope to get this one issue resolved tonight.
